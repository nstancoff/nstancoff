- 👋 Hi, I’m @nstancoff
- 👀 I’m interested in using programming to help create databases and facilitate data analysis. This will hopefully help me as I move into more serious political science research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java as part of an IT minor with Georgia Gwinnett College.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on assignments and help students who need it.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me at stancoff.nathan@gmail.com as a normal user, or nstancoff@ggc.edu if you're a fellow Grizzly.
